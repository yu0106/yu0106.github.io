	v0.1.1.1 (b20200202c):<br/>
			&emsp; * Fixed bug where storms that go off the edge of the map as an in-basin TC remain "currently active" and glitch the timeline after the season ends<br/>
	v0.1.1 (b20200202b):<br/>
			&emsp; * Season timelines now pack better and take the width of the label into account<br/>
			&emsp; * Timeline bars can now be clicked to bring up that storm's info in the side panel<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Individual storm timelines not yet added<br/>
			&emsp; * The "Jump to" button for TCs now jumps to when the storm entered the basin or formed rather than when it initially spawned as a disturbance<br/>
	v0.1 (b20200202a):<br/>
			&emsp; + Added CPac and PAGASA designation-systems for newly-created EPac and WPac map type basins respectively<br/>
			&emsp; * Sub-basins and designation-systems now fully implemented for storm statistics and naming<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > No UI yet to see statistics for sub-basins other than the main basin, but the stats are saved<br/>
			&emsp; * Tracks now include out-basin portions for in-basin storms<br/>

	v20200119a:<br/>
			&emsp; * Partial implementation of SubBasin and DesignationSystem classes<br/>
			&emsp; * Old name list system replaced with DesignationSystem objects to allow more flexible numbering and naming<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Still WIP and doesn't yet have all the intended flexibility<br/>
			&emsp; * Basins now given a main SubBasin for the implementation of DesignationSystem<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Other sub-basins such as PAGASA are still planned for a future update<br/>
			&emsp; * Storms are no longer named "Unnamed" when names are exhausted, but just continue using their number<br/>
	v20200101a:<br/>
			&emsp; * Slight code changes to set up upcoming scale system<br/>
	v20191231a:<br/>
			&emsp; * Updated South-West Indian Ocean names for the 2021-22 list

	v20191109a:<br/>
			&emsp; * Fixed season summary track mode including:<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > storms from previous years whose remnants lasted into the relevant year<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > storms from following years whose precursors formed during the relevant year<br/>
			&emsp; * Fixed timelines not updating after the end of the year without having to view a different season's timeline first<br/>
			&emsp; * Fixed out-basin storms being included in damage, deaths, and landfall stats<br/>
	v20191004a:<br/>

	v20191003a:<br/>
			&emsp; + Added "Experimental" simulation mode<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Currently a normal mode clone with very extreme SSTs<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Expect it to frequently change as it will be used for testing purposes<br/>
			&emsp; * env-defs.js is now sim-mode-defs.js to better encompass what it is for<br/>
			&emsp; * each simulation mode's wave/ET spawning function is defined in sim-mode-defs.js now instead of directly in the Basin.advanceSim method<br/>
			&emsp; * renamed simulation-mode-related constants<br/>
			&emsp; * out-basin now based on a "subBasin number" and a Basin.subBasins object (partial addition of upcoming sub-basins system)<br/>
	v20190911a:<br/>
			&emsp; + Added a landfall counter to storm and season stats<br/>
	v20190827d:<br/>
			&emsp; * Limited "Starting year" selector to only allow years within the valid range of the Javascript Dates<br/>
	v20190827c:<br/>
			&emsp; * Fixed bug where 0001 B.C.E. (or 0002-01 B.C.E.) in the "Starting year" selector doesn't work and the basin uses the default instead<br/>
	v20190827b:<br/>
			&emsp; * Made the crash screen a little better<br/>
	v20190827a:<br/>
			&emsp; * The "Starting year" selector in the New Basin Settings menu now uses a text input box to make selecting a year easier<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Accepts both valid NHem and SHem years (regardless of hemisphere selected with the button above)<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Can use "B.C.E.", "BCE", "BC", "b.c.", etc. for years prior to 1 C.E. ("A.D.", "ce", "C.E.", etc. also treated as valid)<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > SHem years accept both two-digit and full year<br/> numbers after the "-" as valid as long as it represents the year following the one before the "-"<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > A variant of "B.C.E." may be used before the "-" in a SHem year for the special case of 0001 B.C.E.-01 C.E. ("C.E." before "-" is invalid however)<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Any invalid year value may be used to return to the default "Current year"<br/>
			&emsp; * Dates before year 1 are now displayed with "B.C.E." instead of a negative number<br/>
			&emsp; * Fixed broken SHem years before "-1-00" (0002-01 B.C.E.)<br/>
	v20190823a:<br/>
			&emsp; * NCMetadata class replaced with EnvNoiseChannel, which allows more efficient loading of environmental field data<br/>
			&emsp; * "Activity Modes" are now "Simulation Modes" (still referred to by the old name in much of the code)<br/>
			&emsp; * Environmental fields now defined in env-defs.js in a more flexible manner for future changes and simulation modes<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Field definitions among simulation modes are now laid out more neatly<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Console hacks to environmental fields are now a bit easier due to the removal of closures from the map functions and the addition of modifiers<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > The new 'u' utility mini-class offers tools for use in map functions<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Modifiers allow the use of a single map function for multiple simulation modes without cluttering the function with conditionals<br/>
			&emsp; * Environmental fields are now versioned so that future algorithm changes may flag older basins' histories as inaccurate<br/>
			&emsp; * Saves upgraded to format 3, which more flexibly stores environmental field data along with versioning<br/>
	v20190810a:<br/>
			&emsp; + Added two "Periodic Table" name lists<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > The regular one is a continuously looping list<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > The "(Annual)" list resets at the beginning of each year<br/>
	v20190809a:<br/>
			&emsp; * Attempted fix to land being low-res and pixelated in fullscreen after a basin is loaded while a mobile device is in portrait orientation<br/>
	v20190808a:<br/>
			&emsp; * Land, snow, and shader now initially render at full display resolution upon basin loading, and no longer re-render upon fullscreen switches<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Is not hi-res in normal view since it is automatically resized down<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Switching in and out of fullscreen is now a lot faster<br/>
	v20190807a:<br/>
			&emsp; * Fixed awful copy-paste fail in the PAGASA name list (won't fix existing basins)<br/>
	v20190804b:<br/>
			&emsp; * Fixed tropical waves not spawning in megablobs mode<br/>
	v20190804a:<br/>
			&emsp; + Added new activity mode: Megablobs<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Similar to normal mode, but with SST anomaly blobs that can reach extremely high temperatures (more-so than wild mode)<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Jetstream displaced a little poleward similarly to hyper mode<br/>
			&emsp; + Added the magnifying glass, which allows a more high-resolution view of environmental map layers around the pointer<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Can be enabled/disabled from the settings menu, or by pressing "m"<br/>
			&emsp; * Changed color scheme for the SST map layer<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Colors for temperatures up to 32C are now more similar to the color scheme of the graphics on Levi Cowan's tropicaltidbits.com website<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Colors for "hypothetical" temperatures beyond the above scale added particularly for megablobs mode<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Below 0 = white, 0-10 = white to blue, 10-20 = blue to cyan, 20-26 = cyan to green<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > 26-29 = yellow to red, 29-34 = red to very light pink, 34-40 = very light pink to very light lime<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > 40-50 = shades of lime ligher to darker, 50-75 = shades of creamsicle darker to lighter<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > 75&emsp; + = rounds of grey darker to ligher resetting at each multiple of 150<br/>
	v20190801a:<br/>
			&emsp; * Code improvements involving basin and environment initialization<br/>
			&emsp; * Global variables are now actually declared as they should be<br/>
			&emsp; * Stronger storms are now more deadly<br/>
	v20190722b:<br/>
			&emsp; + Added Northern Indian Ocean, Australian Region, South Pacific, and South-West Indian Ocean map modes<br/>
			&emsp; * Fixed some image-compression-related problems with the Eastern Pacific and Western Pacific maps<br/>
	v20190722a:<br/>

	v20190721a:<br/>
			&emsp; + Added Hebrew alphabet to Atlantic and Eastern Pacific name lists for use after the Greek alphabet<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Only applies to new basins<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Technically not an official part of those name lists in the real world, but useful for extreme hyperactivity in this simulator<br/>
			&emsp; * Land is now calculated at twice the normal resolution of the 540p canvas, thus rendering nicely in 1080p in fullscreen<br/>
	v20190718b:<br/>
			&emsp; * Fixed graphical glitch where Atlantic out-basin coloration sticks after returning to main menu and loading another basin<br/>
	v20190718a:<br/>
			&emsp; * Attempt at fixing a bug with the Atlantic map on HiDPI displays<br/>
	v20190717a:<br/>
			&emsp; + Added the long-awaited Atlantic map mode<br/>
			&emsp; + Added the "out-basin" as a region where tropical cyclones may form but are not named nor included in stats<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > The Eastern Pacific and Mediterranean portions of the Atlantic map are out-basin<br/>
			&emsp; * Fixed the environmental field indicator displaying "selected storm" even when a storm isn't selected<br/>
			&emsp; * Fixed newly-created normal activity mode basins not spawning tropical waves<br/>
	v20190716a:<br/>
&emsp;  - Eliminated 'basin' as a global variable<br/>
&emsp;  - Eliminated 'Env' as a global variable<br/>
	v20190714a:<br/>
			&emsp; * Renamed 'OP' activity mode back to 'Hyper' cuz it was sad<br/>
			&emsp; * ActiveSystem class no longer relies on 'basin' as a global variable<br/>
	v20190713a:<br/>
			&emsp; + Added a third activity mode: Wild<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Features a weird season climatology where SSTs are more random and steering is drunken for part of the season<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Storms can form in nearly any watery location on the map<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Season is generally longer and more active than normal<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > July in NHem (January in SHem) is very dry with high SSTs<br/>
			&emsp; * 'Hyper' activity mode is now called 'OP'<br/>
	v20190704b:<br/>
			&emsp; * Fixed non-integer seeds not working correctly<br/>

			&emsp; + Added ability to enter a seed in new basin settings using a text box<br/>
			&emsp; * The loading ring on non-rendering waiting screens now looks like a TC<br/>
			&emsp; * Pressing enter on some text boxes now does the same thing as clicking their associated button<br/>
			&emsp; * Tropical waves now spawn more frequently during off-season in hyper mode<br/>
	v20190702a:<br/>
			&emsp; + Added hypothetical categories (C6-C10 and hypercanes)<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Optionally enabled upon basin creation<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > C8&emsp; + and hypercanes kept track of in season stats<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Can be spawned in god mode<br/>
	v20190630a:<br/>
			&emsp; + Added ability to save basins with a custom name using a text box<br/>
			&emsp; * Finished the full switch from localStorage to indexedDB<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Basins and seasons are now stored in indexedDB<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Saving no longer limited by the localStorage 5 MB limit (Cyclone Sim can now theoretically save up to 10&emsp; % of drive space)<br/>
			&emsp; * You can now save an unlimited number of basins<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Load menu UI updated with pages<br/>
			&emsp; * Saved basins and seasons upgraded to Format 2, which is more efficient and less hacky than the localStorage-limited Format 1<br/>
	v20190622a:<br/>
			&emsp; * Mostly prepared the simulator for asynchronous saving/loading which will come later with the full transition to indexedDB<br/>
			&emsp; * Some tweaks to input UI<br/>
	v20190617a:<br/>
			&emsp; * Mostly finished text input UI code for text boxes to be added in later updates<br/>
	v20190615a:<br/>
			&emsp; * Cleaned up some of the repetative UI code, particularly in the case of buttons<br/>
	v20190613a:<br/>
			&emsp; + Added partial support for indexedDB saving/loading<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Currently only used to store settings, while localStorage is still used for basins and seasons<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Full transition coming in a later update<br/>
			&emsp; + Added new waiting screen (with animated loading ring) for asynchronous tasks<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Not used for rendering as that is single-threaded<br/>
			&emsp; * Various code optimizations for the upcoming switch to storing basins and seasons in indexedDB<br/>
			&emsp; % Added Dexie.js for an easier indexedDB API<br/>
	v20190606a:<br/>
			&emsp; + Added NIO, SWIO, SPac, SAtl, Jakarta, and Port Moresby name lists<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Jakarta and Port Moresby lists are not included in Aus, but completely separate lists for now<br/>
			&emsp; + Added "No Tracks" track mode<br/>
			&emsp; * Updated WPac list preset to reflect the retirement and replacement of 2017 storm names<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Only affects newly created basins<br/>
			&emsp; * Fixed a couple track updating bugs:<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > New track segments getting drawn for non-selected storms while a storm is selected<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Tracks not getting refreshed when the track mode setting button is clicked<br/>
	v20190531b:<br/>
			&emsp; * Season summary timelines now use Greek letters for storms with Greek letter names<br/>
	v20190531a:<br/>
			&emsp; + Added season summary timelines<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Accessible by clicking "Show Timeline" in the info panel<br/>
	v20190526a:<br/>
			&emsp; + Added spawning of subtropical depressions and storms in god mode<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Shift&emsp; +D and click for subtropical depressions<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Shift&emsp; +S and click for subtropical storms<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Pardon me mobile users; I'll add an alternative spawning <br/>method eventually
	v20190525a:<br/>
			&emsp; * Changed how natural storm system spawning works<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Systems (both extratropical and tropical waves) can now spawn at any longitude<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Extratropical systems spawn along the jetstream<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Tropical waves still have a 20&emsp; % tendency to spawn at the eastern edge<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Tropical waves no longer spawn nearly as often during off-season<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Systems in general spawn more frequently<br/>
			&emsp; * Rotating a mobile device between portrait and landscape now toggles fullscreen mode (?)<br/>

	v20190217a:<br/>
			&emsp; + Added track display modes, currently accessed by pressing the "T" key (mobile-friendly UI coming later)<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > There are 3 modes as of this update, which the "T" key cycles through<br/>

			&emsp; * Optimized the environmental field code for future environmental factors, including adding vector support for current steering<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Steering may have gotten yet more drunk for now<br/>
	v20181026b:<br/>

	v20181026a:<br/>
			&emsp; + Crikey mate! Added the southern hemisphere<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > No whole-world added yet, so a basin is just one hemisphere or the other; 50/50 chance at generation<br/>

			&emsp; + Added clickable UI elements/buttons, opening the door for more possibilities in this sim along with better mobile compatibility<br/>
			&emsp; + Added a pause button, which works alongside the existing "space"<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > The indicator text also functions as an extension of the pause button when a storm isn't selected<br/>
			&emsp; + Added a date navigator UI, which can be accessed by clicking the time in the upper left<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Using the arrow buttons, you can jump through analysis by the year, month, day, or advisory increment (6 hours)<br/>

	v20180728a:<br/><br/>
			&emsp; + Added subtropical and extratropical storms<br/>

	v20180721a:<br/><br/>
			&emsp; + Added analysis, allowing you to see history of the sim by pausing and pressing the left and right arrow keys to move forward and backward through time<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Unpause (or press "A" for single-tick advance) to return the time to the present without spamming the right arrow key<br/>
			&emsp; + Added some code for "seasons" (quite unfinished)<br/>
			&emsp; + Added lows, which are anything below 20 mph, which was where storms died before<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Storms now die when they drop below 0 mph<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Hold "L" and click to spawn a low<br/>
			&emsp; * Tracks now disappear as soon as a storm dies, but it can still be seen in analysis<br/>
			&emsp; * Storm icons are now rendered with a method of the StormSystem class to make analysis work more easily<br/>
	v20180719a:<br/><br/>
			&emsp; * Fixed mouse events blocking default browser actions when cursor is outside the canvas, which made it impossible to access the changelog using the link (sorry)
			&emsp; * Fixed first segment of tracks not rendering immediately
	v20180718b:<br/><br/>
			&emsp; * Storms are for now named with a continuously looping 2022 Atlantic hurricane name list (Will be changed)<br/>
			&emsp; * Tracks are no longer rendered every frame, but only when needed, making the sim run faster<br/>
&emsp;  - Removed tracks dissappearing when the framerate drops below 25 fps, as it's no longer needed thanks to the improvement above<br/>
	v20180718a:<br/><br/>
			&emsp; + Added names:<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Depressions recieve a number with the suffix "H" for "Hypothetical"<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Named storms are all named "Unnamed", as this is incomplete<br/>
			&emsp; + Added code for environment factors such as "shear" and "SSTAnomaly", but are not in use yet<br/>
			&emsp; * Changed each simulation tick from 30 minutes to an hour:<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Storms now move twice as fast as seen by the viewer, although they move at the same speed in simulation time<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Strengthening/weakening code is still the same per-tick, so behavior has changed somewhat<br/>
			&emsp; * The time in the upper left uses a slightly different format now<br/>
			&emsp; * Fixed keyboard events blocking default browser actions like "F5" for reload or "F12" for javascript console, except in cases involving keys used for the simulation ("space" doesn't scroll the page down)<br/>
	v20180713a:<br/><br/>
			&emsp; + Added pausing using "space"<br/>
			&emsp; + Added a date counter; currently serves no purpose<br/>
			&emsp; + Added spawning using the keyboard and mouse:<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Hold "D" and click to spawn a tropical depression<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Hold "S" and click to spawn a tropical storm<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > Hold "1" and click to spawn a category 1 hurricane<br/>
			&emsp; &emsp;  > So on for keys "2" through "5"<br/>
			&emsp; + Added stepping one frame (30 sim-minutes) at a time while paused using "A"<br/>
			&emsp; + Added a method to display storms' windspeeds underneath them, enabled using "W"<br/>
			&emsp; * Changed land rendering to better show height<br/>
			&emsp; * Fixed(?) issues involving higher-definition display devices<br/>
			&emsp; * Tracks of dead storms now disappear whenever the framerate drops below 25 fps, not just after their timeout<br/>
			&emsp; * Changed canvas dimensions to 1100x500<br/>
			&emsp; * Tweaked land generation<br/>
			&emsp; % Added moment.js for date and time calculations and display<br/>
	v20180712a:<br/><br/>
			&emsp; + Added land, which weakens storms<br/>
			&emsp; * Made tracks thicker<br/>
			&emsp; * Actually added the CSS and version number to make this consistent with my other experiments<br/>
			&emsp; * Changed rendering so storm symbols always render above tracks<br/>
			&emsp; * Slight tweak to storm strength calculation besides land interaction<br/>
	v20180709a:<br/><br/>
			&emsp; + Initially created a simple hurricane simulator without much regard to realism, nor any land<br/>
			&emsp; % Using p5.js for the first time for any of my experiments</p>
